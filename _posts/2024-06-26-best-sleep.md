I managed to sleep ten hours, which I haven't done in a long time. It was broken sleep as the doggo was out of sorts and spent
a lot of the night pacing - our house is signifantly colder than the dogsitter's (oooh maybe the subject for a blog post).

I also managed an entire day of work (from home), got my inbox from 150 messages down to 50 and had a few productive meetings.

Have I somehow avoided jetlag?
