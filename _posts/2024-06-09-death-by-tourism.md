Prague is a lovely and beautiful city. Shame about all the tourists.

The other day, after checking into our room and having a post-flight shower, we
went out for a walk through the "old town" - the medieval heart of Prague with
delightfully winding and narrow streets. It was absolutely choked with tourists
and, to be honest, not a very pleasant place to be.

Yes I understand that I'm in no position to complain about the tourists, being one
of them myself.

Prague seems very popular with the "I'm about to get married" crowd, and we've seen
quite a few packs of young men wearing matching, custom-made tshirts proclaiming the
end of someone's "freedom".

Over the past couple of days we've learned that the tourists only really seem to
start moving at about ten in the morning, which gives early risers like us a few
hours to wander around the tourist area and enjoy the architecture.

The downside to wandering the tourist areas before the rest of the tourists wake up
is that there's nowhere to get breakfast.
