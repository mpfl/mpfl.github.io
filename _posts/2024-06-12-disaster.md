When you're travelling and can't take all your family members with you, you worry for the
wellbeing of those you leave behind.

Yesterday, while chairing a conference session, my dog sitter told me that Juniper, my greyhound
had been attacked by another dog while on an evening walk.

The most important thing is that she's okay!

She was hurt but received prompt veterinary attention thanks to the actions of my dog sitter,
who took her to an after hours vet. She had to go under a general anaesthetic in order to be
stitched up, but all the damage appears to have been superficial (in the clinical sense).

I'm upset that I'm not there to look after her myself, but I know that my dog sitter (a family
member) is doing everything he can.
