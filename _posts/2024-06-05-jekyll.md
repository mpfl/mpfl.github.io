This website is generated using a system called
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), which takes HTML templates
and Markdown content files to create a static website. No fancy
gimmicks - you site that works on most devices.

The problem is that the source files are hosted in a Github
repository that's easy to edit from the comfort of my desktop
computer, but it's much trickier on a mobile.

This means that editing from an airport is proving
a bit tricky!
