I'm sitting in my hotel room, dressed to go to [parkrun](https://www.parkrun.com/). I like to
be a parkrun tourist when I'm travelling internationally - it often gives me a chance to see
parts of cities I wouldn't otherwise visit.

Unfortunately it's raining quite a bit so no parkrun tourism for me.

I'm pretty bummed out, especially seeing I haven't really done much exercise since I came off my
bike and hurt my shoulder a couple of months ago.
