I used to be in the habit of uploading my "good" shots to Flickr. Where possible, I'd include the Latin scientific name. I also slap on an open and permissive Creative Commons licence so that others can reuse my work in return for attributing me.

Some time ago I was asked if [one of my photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mpfl/16178957261/in/dateposted-public/) could be used in a scientific publication.

I've just received a notice from the author that [the publication](https://doi.org/10.1590/2358-2936e2022014) (Poupin and Lemaitre, 2022) is now published - and is likewise openly licensed so I can see my photo in situ without paying a cent!

And it goes without saying that I should cite the article appropriately in my blog post.
