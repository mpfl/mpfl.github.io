Today was my first full day in Prague, and boy were my legs not prepared.

I'm not normally much of a walker - I prefer my exercise to be a little more intense. But today,
like on many other holidays, we walked a *lot*. My watch marked me at 32,000 steps, covering 22.66km.

It seems I forgot to take photos at most of the lovely scenic lookouts we stopped at, but at least
I got a shot of the Prague Castle (Prasky Hrad) from across the river.

The downside to taking 32,000 steps is that my legwear wasn't appropriate for the activity and now
my inner thighs are quite chafed. Thankfully I have some more suitable undies (bought for running)
that will mitigate that.
