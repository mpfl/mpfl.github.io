Several people I know have, for many years, blogged every day of June.

I'm not one of them, because I struggle to maintain any attempted new habit
for more than a few days. For years I've blamed undiagnosed ADHD on this
inability of mine.

Last year I was finally able to get a prescription for Ritalin and found... not
much changed. I did not experience that "a switch had been flipped" that I heard
from many others.

And now, with recently revelations that ADHD medication is linked to increased
risk of stroke and heart disease, I've stopped taking it.

Back to the matter at hand - blogging every day in June. I'm already two days
late, but I'm backdating this post a couple of days. I'm *cheating*. Hopefully
nobody will mind.
