In two days I'm flying out with my partner to another country, for the first time since 2018. I'll be at
[a conference](https://www.pidfest.org/) for a week, but thankfully I get to spend a week (and three weekends) being a tourist!

I have to admit that this trip is one of the reasons why I thought [#blogjune](/tags/#blogjune) would be quite achievable this year. Every day I'll be
doing something interesting and taking photos to share.

Thankfully I've already backdated several posts this month, because I'll be spending four days in transit with irregular Internet access.

This trip will have an addition to my in-flight entertainment options: audiobooks! Everything I've done is very visual - movies/tv shows,
books, videogames. It will be nice to sit back and shut my eyes while someone reads me a story.
