Last night I slept twelve uninterrupted hours and today I played videogames all day.

After my failure to go to parkrun in Europe, I was intending to go this morning. But the 12 hours of
sleep meant that by the time I woke up, many people would have already finished the run. Maybe this
coming weekend?

It was nice to have a day where there was nothing new or unexpected. A day where my brain could just
switch off and not have to incorporate anything new into its mental model for how the world works.

I like exercising my brain as much as the next nerd, but being "on" all the time is exhausting.
