The [Pedal Comet]{https://www.99bikes.com.au/pedal-comet-st-electric-cruiser-bike-black-orange} is an inexpensive ebike
from [99 Bikes]{https://www.99bikes.com.au/}, a chain of bicycle stores in Australia and New Zealand.

Although I would prefer to ride my more traditional bicycle to work as often as possible, the ebike adds more flexibility
as I can get to work without turning into a sweaty mess and needing a shower. This means I can avoid using the car when I
sleep in or have to do some chores before work.

Unfortunately for a nerd like me, the bike is so inexpensive that they seem to have forgotten to include the manuals for
all the ebike components, such as the motor (a Bafang SWXH6 250W), the battery ("Samsung"), and the LCD display (labelled
only as "Key Disp").

Thankfully, using my librarian powers I was able to determine the model number for the LCD display (KD21C) and get a copy
of [its manual](/assets/pdf/kd21c.pdf). The manual details all of the button presses you need to make to access the settings
menu and change various options.

Please be careful, however, as the settings menu lets you change the maximum assist speed of the motor. Increasing the
speed might let you go faster, but it will probably have a negative impact on your battery life and, even worse, you might
be breaking the law in your state or country.
