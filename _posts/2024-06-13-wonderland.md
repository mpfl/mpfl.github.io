I'm certainly not good at this daily blogging! Daily blagging is much easier. I'm writing on a Saturday
but pretending that it's still Thursday the day after a pleasant conference social pretending to be a
river cruise.

I've been working with a few people from international partner organisations for quite some time, and
this week is the first opportunity I've had to meet most of them in person.

The river cruise social was quite delightful. I've never been on a boat going through a lock before, so
that was something to tick off the nerd list.

I was the only person to break a glass, and that happened when I knocked a glass off a table with my bag
as everyone was getting ready to disembark.
