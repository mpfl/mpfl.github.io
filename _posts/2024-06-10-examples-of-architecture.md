Someone told me that the reason why Prague is so beautiful is because it was never
bombed during the second World War, so many examples of old architecture survived the
conflict unscathed.

I enjoyed this building that was bedecked in art nouveau style - possibly one of my
favourite styles.

This pink hotel tickled some fancy.

The Žižkov Television Tower stands incongrously amongst the much older buildings. It also
has a restaurant that offers a delicious breakfast, commanding views, and a dearth of
tourists at breakfast.

Trying to show lots of pictures is highlighting an issue I have with Jekyll - I'm not sure
what the best way of creating something akin to an image gallery is! I'm limited by the
capability of Github pages. I'm sure there's some documentation somewhere I can read.
