It's 6:51 and I'm in my hotel room. I woke up about an hour ago and have spent much of the past
hour trying to work out where I can get a coffee.

My hotel isn't fancy enough to have a restaurant (or even reception, for that matter) and the
earliest any nearby cafes open is after I need to leave to get to my conference.

A first world problem for sure, but it doesn't mean it's not a problem.
