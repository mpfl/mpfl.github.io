Aha, there's the jetlag.

Fell asleep on the couch at 19:30 last night so went to bed at around my normal time.

Woke up at 01:30 to find my partner was already out on the couch, watching TV.

Played videogames for a few hours then crawled back to bed for a further three hours.

Send coffee.

I somehow make the most exciting travel seem mundane, but [#blogjune](/tags/#blogjune) is about quantity not quality, right?

Right!?
