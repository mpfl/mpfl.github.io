Today was a transit day - Salzburg to Vienna on train (of course). The train arrived late at
Salzburg, so we left 20 minutes late. Then there was a switch failure near Vienna, so we had
to take an alternate route that delayed us a further 20 minutes.

Thankfully we didn't have any connections or appointments, so the delay didn't mean much in
the grand scheme of things.

I was hoping for some delightful scenery on the way, but it turns out that the route from
Salzburg to Vienna is largely urbanised. Had much better views a couple of days ago
